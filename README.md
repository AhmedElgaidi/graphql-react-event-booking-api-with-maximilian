## [Create Graphql API with (React, NodeJS and MongoDB)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51rG1x02Yyj93iypUuHYXcB_)


- `experss-graphql package:` It's a package that can be used as a middleware in exprses-node applications and helps us to point to a schema and resolvers and automatically connected them for use and route requests to a parser and then handle them according to our defined schema and forward to the right resovlers!
- `graphql package:` A package that helps us to define a schema according to the official GraphQl specifications and definitions


#### [Notes]:
1) Schema in GraphQL API is just like an enpoints in rest API
2) Resolvers in GraphQL APi is just like controllers in the rest API.
3) GraphQL isn't related to any backend server, database type or even a frontend client!! `It's indenpedent and can work with whatever you are using on both sides!!`
4) GraphQL is a typed language, It works with types to define what a certain endpoint should accept and return!
